\noindent Dear Editor, \\

Please consider for publication in the Journal of Computational Physics 
the attached manuscript entitled {\em A moment-of-fluid method for diffusion equations on irregular domains in multi-material systems}. 
The significance and novelty of this paper are: \par 

A simple, robust, first-order accurate finite-volume method, coupled with the moment of fluid procedure, which can handle the diffusion problem in multiple materials system occupying highly complex geometry, is proposed. Our method is a lower order method, but could handle multi-material diffusion with filamentary region without the need of AMR.


  

Thank you for your time and consideration. \\
Sincerely yours,\\
